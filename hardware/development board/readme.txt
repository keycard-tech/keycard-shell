For security reasons Shell in presales and sales have a locked bootloader that can only run firmwares which have been signed by Keycard CA key. This insures our users that they can trust the software they run. 

For developers who want to develop Keycard firmware, we will 
- release full files of a development board you can build yourself (goal early June max)
- we will assemble some development board and sell them on our site 

In the meantime, get in touch with us either 
- on our discord server https://discord.gg/uJAXk7jFhZ
- our here with a GitHub issue or GitHub discussion
