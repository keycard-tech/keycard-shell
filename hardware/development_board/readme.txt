For security reasons Shell in presales and sales have a locked bootloader that can only run firmwares which have been signed by Keycard CA key. This insures our users that they can trust the software they run. 

For developers who want to develop Shell firmware, you will find in this folder the full design of a development board for Shell

The folder '/devboard_v1' contains this design. Please note that there are some differences in the STM32 pinout between this development board version and shell board.

We'd need someone to update the layout of this dev board based on latest shell designs so that the dev board can actually run the shell builds.

Probably the best way to do this, would be to use the design and schematic from 'serial_run' version and make it in the form factor of this development board
